## 🧠 Key Insights

- Most accidents occur **within 20 meters of junctions**.
- **Birmingham** has the highest number of accidents; **Berwick-upon-Tweed** has the least.
- **Dry roads** record the highest accident count, likely due to driver overconfidence and high traffic on clear days.
- **Speed limit 30 km/h** roads with **uncontrolled junctions** show more severe accidents.
- Peak accident time is **6 PM**, especially on **Fridays** when roads are **wet or damp**.
